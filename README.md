There's a lot to be learned from the 2016 presidential election. That's why I decided to build a web scraper that looks at data from Politico.com.

This python script can extract the percentage of voters who voted for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton from every county.

## What you'll need:
* Selenium.
* BeautifulSoup4

You can google how to install them yourself.
